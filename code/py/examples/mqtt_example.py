"""
SHORT EXAMPLE FOR MQTT COMMUNICATION.

To install Mqtt client and broker, follow the instructions 
in the README.md file, inside the '.py' folder.

Before you run the program, make sure you've started the
Mosquitto broker in your terminal/cmd by running:

$ mosquitto -v

It should be running on port 1883 by default.
